# Game Show App

Browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) are used to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

## Features

- Space theme

## Space Theme

A space themed background was added to the start and game sections. A space font was used throughout the game. The heart life icons were replaced by spaceship icons. When a letter from the phrase is revealed a spinning animation was added. On the game over screen, if the user won the game, a confetti animation appears.
